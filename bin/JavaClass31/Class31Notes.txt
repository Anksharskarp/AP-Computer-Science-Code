General Rules for Recursion
----------
1. Avoid recursion for algorithms that involve large local arrays --
too many recursive calls can cause memory overflow.

2. Use recursion when it significantly simplifies code.

3. Avoid recursion for simple iterative methods like factorial, Fibonacci,
and the linear search.

4. Recursion is especially useful for:
   - Branching processes like traversing trees or directories.
   - Divide-and-conquer algorithms like mergesort and binary search.
