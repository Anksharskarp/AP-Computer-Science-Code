## Introduction

Welcome to my code snippets and samples from the EasyFunCoding Advanced I class! These files were created from 2020 to 2021, and are continued to be maintained. Feel free to contact me via GitHub if you have any suggestions for improving my **spaghetti** code. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
