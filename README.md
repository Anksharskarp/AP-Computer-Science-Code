## Introduction

Welcome to my code snippets and samples from the EasyFunCoding Advanced I class! These files were created from 2020 to 2021, and are continued to be maintained. Feel free to contact me via GitHub if you have any suggestions for improving my **spaghetti** code. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).

## Troubleshooting (I)

If you encounter a `Failed to Load Main Class` or `Main Class Not Found` error, simply restart the Java Language Workspace by pressing `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` and selecting `Restart and Delete Java Language Workspace.` Otherwise, try updating the Project Manager for Java in Visual Studio Code. 

## Troubleshooting (II)

If the above solution still doesn't work, then install the Eclipse New Java Project extension from Andrew Mellen. It creates special folders, such as a `.classpath`, a `.project`, and a `bin` folder than includes complied binaries for the code. This can be emulated in other popular Java code editors such as IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse, where a `New Project` button can help add the additional necessary files for successful compilation of the code. 


**Note: Once you rebuild the project, make sure you add in the `package` keyword, which has important information about the folder in which the `.java` code file resides.
